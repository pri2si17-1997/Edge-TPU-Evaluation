# Medical Imaging Model Optimization for Edge TPU

This contains source code for the paper `LEAPFROGGING MEDICAL AI IN LOW-RESOURCE CONTEXTS USING EDGE TENSOR PROCESSING UNIT`.

`chest_xray_classification` contains source code for classification model optimization and evaluation whereas `nerve_segmentation` contains source code for ultrasound segmentation model optimization and evaluation. They have their separate README in their respective directory.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank "[`George Batchkala`](https://www.kaggle.com/gbatchkala)", "[`Will Arevalo`](https://www.kaggle.com/willarevalo)" and "`John Beltran`" for their source code on top of which we performed optimization.
